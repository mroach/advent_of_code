# Advent of Code

Problems come from http://adventofcode.com and there's one for each day of Advent.

## 2017 
So far these are done with Ruby 2.3 and can be executed simply:

```
$ ./day2.rb
```

## TODO

Add RSpec tests that use the sample inputs and answers from the site.

## 2018

The year of Elixir
